### To-do

+ Faster updating visualization - possible, but requires a lot of work:
	+ Try update plot instead full redo - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4098131/how-to-update-a-plot-in-matplotlib , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16120801/matplotlib-animate-fill-between-shape
	+ Use pygame-matplotlib backend instead RGBA buffer - https://github.com/lionel42/pygame-matplotlib-backend/issues/3
+ Track lap time to score model
